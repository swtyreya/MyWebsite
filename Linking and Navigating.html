	<h2 style= "color : green"  id=  "URL" > URLs </h2>
	<dd>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. 
	In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc. 
	In practice, there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resource that no longer exists or that has moved. 
	As the resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server to 
	carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.</dd>
	<h2 style= "color : green"  id=  "SourceAnchors" > Source Anchors </h2>
	<dd> The Source Anchor Attribute is considered an Immutable ID, meaning, once set and the identifier has been synced, it cannot be modified. 
	This attribute is utilized during the following scenarios: Introducing a new sync engine, or a rebuilt engine.</dd>
	<h2 style= "color : green" id=	 "DestinationAnchors"> Destination Anchors </h2>
	<dd>A link has two ends -- called anchors -- and a direction. The link starts at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor,
	which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within an HTML document, etc.).</dd>
	<h2 style= "color : green" id=	 "Examples"> Examples </h2>
	<dd> Destination anchors in HTML documents may be specified either by the A element (naming it with the name attribute), or by any other element 
	(naming with the id attribute). Thus, for example, an author might create a table of contents whose entries link to header elements H2 , H3 , etc.,
	in the same document.</dd>
